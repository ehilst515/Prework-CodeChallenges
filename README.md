## Problem 1
Given an array select a number that exists, and output the computated "score". The method you create should take in both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.

Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10 from the user. Output the array to the console and ask the user to select a number. After the selection, output the "score" of the number chosen.

Selection and Scoring Algorithm
You can select any number from the list, however your scoring will be depend on the frequency of that number in the list. E.g for [2,2,3,5,4] if you pick 2 your score will be 4 (2 * 2) but if you pick 5 your score will be 5 (5 * 1)


## Problem 2
Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
